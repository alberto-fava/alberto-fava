Hi! I'm Alberto, nice to meet you :)

I'm a Mechanical Engineering student at the Polytechnic of Turin. I'm 21, I'm passionate about space and technology, and I'm always full of energy!

I'm currently working on:
> Grow in Tech coding/soft skills coure for italian high schoolers

> A slicing and compiling software for an EBM 3d printer

I'm deeply interested in manufacturing technologies for LEO/LLO environments so, if you're up to it, let's chat!
